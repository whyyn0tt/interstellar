### Camouflage images

Collecting all the camouflage images from the previous Call of Duty game (Modern Warfare II) was not an easy task, especially since new camouflages were released with each new season. As of writing there are ***273*** unique camouflages that can be unlocked in that game.

If you would like to contribute with images of the new camouflages for this installment of Call of Duty, see [this section](https://github.com/carlssonemil/interstellar/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#camouflage-images) in the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/carlssonemil/interstellar/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
